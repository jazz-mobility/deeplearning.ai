# Module 1: Introduction to Agentic Workflows

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Duration**: ~1 hour

## Overview

This module introduces the fundamentals of agentic AI systems - AI that can reason, plan, and take multi-step actions to achieve goals autonomously.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what makes AI systems "agentic"
- Learn about different degrees of autonomy
- Explore task decomposition strategies
- Understand evaluation methods for agentic systems
- Identify real-world applications and use cases

## Key Concepts

### Agentic AI
AI systems that can:
- Set and pursue goals
- Plan multi-step workflows
- Iterate and improve outputs
- Adapt to changing conditions
- Learn from feedback

### Design Patterns
- **ReAct**: Reasoning + Acting
- **Plan-and-Execute**: Upfront planning with execution
- **Reflection**: Self-evaluation and iteration
- **Tool Use**: Integrating external capabilities

### Evaluation Approaches
- Task success rates
- Step efficiency
- Quality of intermediate outputs
- Human evaluation
- A/B testing
